# Movie Namer
Renames Folders in a Directory

If you download movie torrents then the foldernames of your movies are rather
horribly named. This renames them to be something readable and also
created a directory for movies not in a folder; in the folder this is run,
and places the folderless movies in their own nicley names folder.

for example

A Great Film-1972-yst[1080]-rus sub

gets named

A Great Film (1972)

The program also creats an Html file that'll contain links to rotten tomatoes
for all the folders (films)
